    "## Objectives\n",
    "In this practicum, you and your lab partner will experiment with data collection, annotation, and turning a simple computer vision task into a machine learning problem.\n",
    "This practicum will not go very deep in machine learning theory, but is more intended to make you familiar with the broader context of how machine learning can be applied in robotics, and experience some practical steps in performing your own data collection.\n",
    "You will also demonstrate that you can perform several basic tasks with sklearn which have been explained in the book chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is roughly organised into the steps of the \"Machine Learning Project Checklist\" explained in *Chapter 2 and Appendix B of the book*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Framing the problem](#framing_the_problem)\n",
    "2. [Get the data](#get_the_data)\n",
    "3. [Explore the data](#explore_the_data)\n",
    "4. [Prepare the data](#prepare_the_data)\n",
    "5. [Explore different models](#explore_different_models)\n",
    "6. [Fine-tune your models](#fine_tune_your_models)\n",
    "7. [Present your solution](#present_your_solution)\n",
    "8. [Launch, monitor, and maintain your system](#maintain_your_system)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are many more decisions and variations that could be explored at each step, but we will keep it simple for this exercise, so do not take this assignment as an exact template of what should or should not be done in each step. In real life, you would probably also move back and forward between these steps, revising some earlier decisions as you gain more insight on the problem. Nevertheless, this practicum provides a good guideline of how to approach such a task."

    "# 1. Framing the problem\n",
    "The context of this practicum is of a robot which will need to be able to pickup a pen from a desk or table. The robot has a basic down-facing camera that it can place on top of the desk to inspect an area of interest.\n",
    "The goal is to detect within this area where the pen is located, and how it is oriented.\n",
    "To train the robot's perception system, we obtain a \"pen image dataset\" where the pen's extents (the physical tip and end) have been manually annotated in each image.\n",
    "When the robot is deployed (a.k.a. *test* time), the robot will have to determine the locations of the tip and end of a pen in front of its camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we design a system that takes an image as input, and outputs the location and orientation of the pen?\n",
    "We might consider two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formulate this as a _regression_ problem:** Given an image, convert the full image to some feature representation and train a regressor that outputs 4 values, namely the (x,y) image locations of the tip, and the (x,y) locations of the end of the pen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formulate this as a _classification_ problem:** Divide the given image into small image patches. For each patch in the image, classifiy if this patch is the tip (start) of the pen, the end of the pen, the middle of the pen, or if it is just background. If we could succesfully classify patches at a diverse set of locations in the image, we would could determine the most probable image locations where the pen starts and ends, and thus its shape and orientation relative to the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the regression formulation might seem more natural, processing many local image regions in parallel is a more common practice in many machine learning for computer vision applications. The classification formulation could for instance be extended to work with images containing multiple pens, which simply ammounts to more image patches containing a tip, end or middle section, so the input and output space of the learned hypothesis function remains the same. In contrast, for regression we would need to change the output space to 8 values (namely four (x,y) coordinates) if we want to deal with two pens, thus changing the structure of the hypothesis function compared to the single pen case. Each different number of pens would thus require a different hypothesis function if we apply regression naively this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore follow the **classification** approach in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information our robot should have enough information to position and orient its (imaginary) grasper, and pick up the pen and put it in its pen collection.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main steps of the operational procedure in this figure are:\n",
    "1. Take the input image, and extract smaller image patches around a diverse set of image location (shown as blue dots).\n",
    "2. Once the patches are extracted, each patch is converted into some feature vector $x$.\n",
    "3. The feature vectors are then fed to a trained classifier, which will assign to a patch one of four class labels:  background, tip of the pen, end of the pen, or middle of the pen.\n",
    "4. After all patches in the image are classified, we post-process the result. Here we select the location of the patch for which the classifier is most confident that it belongs to the pen's tip, and the one for which it is most confident that it belongs to the pen's end. We assume the pen is located along the line connecting these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "To built such a system, we thus first have to create a labelled dataset $X$ of image patches with the four class labels. With this dataset, we can select and optimise a suitable classifier. Other important choices are how many patches of each class we include in the training data, and how we represent each patch as a feature vector."

We will here use Shannon's entropy from information theory using base 2. The entropy $H$ can then be interpreted as the expected number of bits of information that is needed to communicate the class label $c$ of a random sample from $P$. Again as an extreme, if all samples would have the same class label, there would be no \"uncertainty\", and no information needs to be communicated about the label of an arbitrary sample, corresponding to $H = 0$ bits of information. On the other hand, if you have 8 equally probable class labels and thus full uncertainty about the label of any random sample, you would be expected to communicate $H = 3$ bits of information to indicate which of the $2^3 = 8$ labels that particular sample has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this formula assumes that all classes have at least a non-zero chance of occurring, and you might run into numeric issues if $P(c) = 0$ for one or more classes $c$. The best thing to do is to remove any zero-probability classes if they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you must implement this function yourself. You can numpy functions, but not any other statistical python packages."
